when i wrote programs on streetinterview (now hackerrank.com ) my program was not invested in time literally by a percentage within the allotted limit. i exclusively with the help of register (rather by iterative search method than logically, because there were very not obvious consequences) picked up so that the program on my amd worked 5 percent faster. i sent the program to streetinterview and saw a 10 drop in performance on their xeon. for the sake of persuasiveness, i launched it a couple of times and since then i have not used register, so as not to dream.
